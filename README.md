# SMAI_Implementation

Comprehensive Statistical Modeling and ML algorithm Implementations done as a part of a course on Statistical Methods in AI.

For brevity, data sources haven't been included. Every part includes extensive hyperparameter tuning, data exploration and model optimizations wherever possible.

## Part 1

- Implemented the k-Nearest Neighbours algorithm from scratch
- Optimized the algorithm through vectorization
- Used powerset and multi-output formulations of classfication with decision trees

## Part 2

- Implemented functionality for Principle Component Analysis from scratch
- Implemented Gausian Mixture Models (Expectation Maximization Algorithm) from scratch
- Conducted ablations for hierarchical clustering

## Part 3

- Implemented multinomial linear and logistic regression from scratch
- Implemented multilayer perceptrons from scratch
- Implemented CNN and autoencoders using inbuilt Torch modules

## Part 4

- Implemented Bagging and Stacking algorithms from scratch
- Implemented Random Forrest, AdaBoost and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees

## Part 5

- Implemented Kernel Density Estimation from scratch
- Tuned over Hidden Markov Model parameters for diverse applications
